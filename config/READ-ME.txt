I have added the postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf files that will be used to setup the database

Due to postgres running on localhost I did not need to include the server.key and server.crt files

The installation instructions are included below:

To install the .conf files, run these commands:
sudo cp postgresql.conf /etc/postgresql/13/main/
sudo cp pg_hba.conf /etc/postgresql/13/main/

To create the postgres usr run this command:
sudo -u postgres psql template1

When in the psql shell, run this sql statement;
ALTER USER postgres with encrypted password 'pass';

Restart the service so the changes take effect:
sudo systemctl restart postgresql.service
